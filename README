It seems that github likes README files, so here it goes

Windows 7 Jump List Support for Visual Studio 2008 allows you to store your most used (or recent) projects on the Windows 7 Jump List.

There are a couple or registry hacks out of there, but they are not a good solution when you have multiple versions of Visual Studio installed on the same machine...

To compile you need Windos 7 SDK

 - Install Windows 7 SDK
 - Set as the default SDK for Visual Studio 2008 (or do some other magic and let me know later, I didn't have time to invest on it.
 
 Good compiling!
